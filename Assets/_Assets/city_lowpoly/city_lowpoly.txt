How to use:

- Simply use the kind of buildings you are interested in from the "prefabs" folder.
Note that prefabs are available in "closed meshes" version in case that is required
by a plugin you are using. Some residential buildings are not available in 
"closed meshes" version, also note that these meshes are a bit higher poly count. 
Tweak diffuse texture size to fit your needs (1024x1024 / 2048x2048 max depending on texture).

- Please note that normally you will need to update the cubemap for reflectivity.
I recommend the use of this free cube map maker for Unity for building reflections:

- Also note that demo scenes use Pro camera post effects that will not be available in
Unity free. These effects are disabled by default.

- If you want to reuse demo scenes, you will find some resources used only on these scenes
inside their folder (scenes > demo# >  resources).

- For any building related material, please go to meshes > materials.
